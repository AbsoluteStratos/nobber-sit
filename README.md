### Automation

For the Github Workflow automation there are three items needed:

- `GH_PAT`: Github personal access token for this repo scope, with contents (read and write) permissions. This is needed so the update commits from the workflow will trigger the gh-pages
pipelines.
- `TWITCH_API_CLIENT_ID`: API client ID gotten from registering a [twitch app to the API](https://dev.twitch.tv/console/apps)
- `TWITCH_API_CLIENT_SECRET`: API client ID gotten from registering a [twitch app to the API](https://dev.twitch.tv/console/apps)

> For the twitch app, the oauth url can be `https://localhost`
